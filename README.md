# Sentiment_Analyzer
Created November 2018:
<br /> This program prompts the user for a reviews file and a stop word file. The reviews file consists of a collection of movie reviews with thier respective ratings at the start. These files are used to analyze words and give each word a score. The stop words are words like a, the, is, etc. that do not have any sentiment. A hash table with trees is used to store words and keep track of thier values. This program asks the user if they want to test a phase. If a phrase is input, the sentiment value of the given phrase is output.
